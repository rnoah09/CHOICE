Congratulations! Through the first 2 chapters, you have finally made a decision. All that is left for you to do is follow through! This is the most important step in overcoming your indecisive Earthling mindset. Following through with a decision, even if it ends up being a bad one, will help you learn and prepare for the next time you have to make a decision. Brenden Dilley, author of “Still Breathin’: The Wisdom & Teachings of a Perfectly Flawed Man“ states that “The majority of indecisive people struggle to let go of past mistakes … Failure after failure grooms them to second guess, overanalyze and thoroughly dissect every decision they make. Eventually, they become paralyzed every time they’re confronted with a decision”. These failures should not be taken to heart, and instead move on and learn from them.

Remember that even if you believe you cannot handle the consequences of certain decisions, research  by Columbia University psychologist George Bonanno shows that people are very resilient, able to learn and grow from past mistakes and setbacks. This myth that you will not be able to bounce back is because of “affective forecasting”, in which humans exaggerate the potential outcomes of a decision. So, as a limited, imperfect human, take a step forward, even through uncertainty, to make a decision and stay true to it.

Before making any decisions: calm down. Don’t overthink it. Earthlings like you don’t have to know everything — there’s no way you can in the first place. Take a few figurative steps back and breathe. Taking even, steady breaths is great for calming nerves and stimulating your brain, not to mention that humans who don’t breathe are usually dead.

Sherianna Boyle, human author of “The Four Gifts of Anxiety”, states that “Anxiety is your body’s attempt to direct you back to yourself so you can receive information that is more accurate. When we act impulsively or react quickly, very often this information is tainted with fear”. Breathing deep breaths and calming your nerves will help you to receive more information so you can make accurate decisions. Several ways you can reduce anxiety and fear besides breathing include:

Count to 10 slowly
Accept that you cannot control everything.
Welcome humor.
Maintain a positive attitude.
Talk to someone.

Once you have removed your emotions from the equation, it is time to analyze your choices. Weigh your choices, and see how they compare to each other. During this time, it is very helpful for humans to visualize their options in a very simple way, to get an understanding of how you might feel in each scenario. Another important strategy during analysis is to take your time. Studies show that taking your time when making decisions, you will overall make better ones. Of course, this is assuming you have time to spare, but either way, don’t feel rushed when making decisions.

Keep in mind that when figuring out your decision it is important to be able to see it in several different angles. Career development expert Kate Wilson explains that “There are several strategies to promote clarity, such as thinking in a [different] language — if you happen to speak another — or consider the situation as a third party… Each of these strategies works to help remove emotion and clarify your understanding of the situation.”

Finally, remember one of the key methods of making decisions is through gathering information, both from the choices themselves and yourself. Knowing everything about the decision you have to make will give you the confidence to make the right decision.
